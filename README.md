Green Summer
===========


1. Retrospective  

The screaming crowd called for me again, but I listened to my instincts and my heels calmly clicked to return backstage from the glitz and raw emotions with my dignity intact.  The glaring lights and flashes had long turned my retinas into burned out husks of their former selves, and the ticker tape was so deep I had to nearly wade through it. 

In retrospect, it ought to have been obvious to everyone that it was never going to work out like we had hoped. After the Peacemaker though...we just believed that we could, that it was inherent within us, humanity's true legacy.  Even from the beginning, though, things got out of control all too quickly. 

"What was that all about, Jean?  We are supposed to be wrapping this up, not tearing everything all apart!  I know the script you were given, and that was not even close."

I took a deep breath and put on my most conciliatory face. 

"No worries, Dave.  The people know what we're about by now.  They should anyway, since they just voted us into office," I laughed and slid into the stylist's chair for yet another touch up. "They want what we've offered, and we're going to give it to them."

Dave leaned in and gave me a peck on the cheek, then lightly punched my shoulder, saying, "This isn't a fucking college debate anymore, Jean.  We have to present a uniform front to the opposition, or we'll end up back where we were 20 years ago again.  The people care about the environment now, because they know that is the only thing that keeps us from becoming another China.  But what happened to the line on arthritis treatment?  The job services in the education and health care sectors?  It's all well and good to have a pristine planet, but people still have to eat and have a roof over their heads!"

That was the line he kept coming back to. And I understood what he wanted, I really did.  The problem was I just didn't believe in it, not in the same way that Dave did.  

That was what made us great on the campaign trail. We offered it all, the full package.  After the Republicans fell, decapitated by their own Tea Party denizens really, the Democrats were left with a whole lot of disenfranchised people who simply didn't know who the opposition was anymore. The Peacemaker had convinced them, one deal at a time, one day at a time, that it could work.  The religious right...they got it now. They didn't believe the left was out to destroy them, because there wasn't a left anymore. There wasn't a right either.  There was just a whole lot of confused, tired, and...non-combatant people.   So we came out of nowhere and stirred up a whole pile of shit in their faces.

We asked these people, why couldn't we take care of our planet?  Why couldn't we take care of the people? Why can't we have it all? After all, we argued, even Jesus wanted both to take care of people, and to take good stewardship of what we have. What the hell was the point of government, if not to take care of these things?  And the people ate it up. 

I promised them the stars and the earth, and David promised them the jobs and the social care and infrastructure and education to make it all happen.  We knew what the progs wanted, we knew what the greens wanted, we were the combined total of both parties.  There wasn't anybody left, other than us.  The love story David and I had spun for them was their story of hope for a future where China's fate wasn't ours.  

I rounded on Dave saying, "You knew I wouldn't promise them the re-opening of the Alaskan underwater pipeline!  I can't understand why you ever thought I'd be willing to go along with that.  It's an ecological disaster, and always has been. For Christ's sake, don't you remember the towns burning..."

My voice broke, "We're going to have to make enough compromises as it is. I just don't want to start doing it now, when we've just been elected. Give the greens a few days bliss.  This is our first chance in the limelight in the history of the party. "

"Awww, Jeanie, I know how you feel about it. I just thought that you understood that the solar tech just isn't ready yet. It will be, I promise. We will make it ready."

But we didn't. There was just no way for us to get the infrastructure running enough to keep the R&D sector running without opening back up the pipeline. It was that or start on-shore fracking again, and there wasn't a Mid-Western citizen who would have re-elected us if we would have done that. We'd already dammed up every river available for local power generation, but ever since China's Green Summer, the data storage centers were back in the US.  If we wanted to keep the public sector running, we simply had to have enough fuel to run Google and Microsoft's fleets. 

It took massive investitures of capital to create a single oil-free city.  Only the largest could do it, and most of rural America was still running on gas stations.   Sure, the self-driving cars helped in that traffic was generally smooth now, but oil cars were still cheap and prevalent, even fifteen years after they had been converted to run with the major player algorithms as public transport vehicles. 

Meanwhile, the bread basket had moved north.  The globe had hit a tipping point that we hadn't expected, that the scientists had known existed, but didn't know when it would strike. The old Midwest was forever changed, the South an unexpected near-constant sandstorm. Washington, Montana, they were the new grain champions.  Politicians tried to reverse it for ten years before Dave and I took office, and god knows that we tried too.

Maybe we thought it was going to be easy.  Maybe we were young and foolish, and just silly in love, like the pundits used to like to say.  Maybe we really were. But we hoped, and pegged the future of the nation, on the semi-religious notion, nay, the faith, that it was more than that.
